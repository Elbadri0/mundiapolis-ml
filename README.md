Testing your code
In order to test your code, youâ€™ll need DATA! Please download these datasets (Binary_Train.npz, Binary_Dev.npz, MNIST.npz) to go along with all of the following main files. You do not need to upload these files to GitHub. Your code will not necessarily be tested with these datasets. All of the following code assumes that you have stored all of your datasets in a separate data directory.
