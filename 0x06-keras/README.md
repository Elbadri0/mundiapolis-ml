# 0x06 Keras

> Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is Keras?
* What is a model?
* How to instantiate a model (2 ways)
* How to build a layer
* How to add regularization to a layer
* How to add dropout to a layer
* How to add batch normalization
* How to compile a model
* How to optimize a model
* How to fit a model
* How to use validation data
* How to perform early stopping
* How to measure accuracy
* How to evaluate a model
* How to make a prediction with a model
* How to access the weights/outputs of a model
* What is HDF5?
* How to save and load a model’s weights, a model’s configuration, and the entire model

## Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15) and tensorflow (version 1.12)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import tensorflow.keras as K
